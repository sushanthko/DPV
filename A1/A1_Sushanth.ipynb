    "It is quite common for programmers to not remember all the functions and all possible parameters. One skill that is important to master: ability to quickly find documentation and examples on the internet. Several tips:\n",
    "1. Try typing your question in Google. For example, if you wonder how to read a CSV file in this context, you can try to Google [\"python Pandas read CSV DataFrame\"](https://www.google.com/?q=python%20Pandas%20read%20CSV%20Dataframe) and with high chance one of the top 5 results will give you the answer. Just \"Read CSV\" will not be enough. You should mention the context. For the assignments of this course the context typically is \"Python Pandas\". \n",
    "2. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is one of the best resources for programming questions. It has a lot of different questions and answers. When you have a question, there is a 90% chance that someone has had exactly that question before and someone else has answered him/her. But typically it is enough to type the question in Google. All roads (i.e., programming questions) lead to StackOverflow anyway :).\n",
    "3. Check out the official documentation of the libraries that you are using. If you wonder about some DataFrame functions, find the DataFrame page in Pandas documentation. Hint: typically Google is smart enough to bring you to the documentation page. If you simply type [\"Pandas DataFrame\"](https://www.google.no/search?q=pandas+dataframe&oq=pandas+dataframe), the first result will typically be the documentation page. Official documentation is typically the page with the most detailed information on exactly the class or function that you need to explore. If you wonder about the possible function parameters, etc, see the docs."
